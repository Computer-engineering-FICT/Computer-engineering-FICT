  <a name="introduction"></a>
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction
</h2>

DocFlex is a new technology for rapid development of template-based documentation/report
generators built into Java&#153; applications.
<p class="mrg8">
It is based on an idea that most of the data a typical application operate have a tree or network
structure and generally can be represented in the form similar to Document Object Model
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/" target="_blank">DOM</a>) of XML files.
(In fact, that's why XML is widely used to export/import those data and exchange between applications.)
<p class="mrg8">
Following that idea, it is possible to imagine that if we had some abstract interface that
represents most of the practically used data sources in a from similar to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/" target="_blank">DOM</a>, we could process such data
using a single tool, which is based only on the concepts of XML (possibly with a few
enhancements) and employs available standards and approaches developed around it.
<p class="mrg8">
DocFlex technology was devised as an implementation of that idea for the task of
representing the application data in some human-readable form, i.e. generating various
reports and documentation.
<p class="mrg8">
Another idea related to that task and sought to achieve in DocFlex Technology is a
universal approach for specifying formatting of the output documents and generating a common
network of hyperlinks interconnecting them.
<p class="mrg8">
The natural way to achieve all those goals would be to introduce a new programming medium
in the form of a <i>scripting language</i> or <i>templates</i>.
<p class="mrg8">
A scripting language is typically something intended for manual coding, compiling and running
with an interpreter. Normally, this approach provides powerful expressive capabilities however
in expense of a rather laborious way of using them. In addition, in the case of XML, 
such a scripting language already exists.
It is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/" target="_blank">XSL</a>,
which is an elaborated programming language (the second generation now).
XSL probably represents almost all what could be achieved in that way.
Yet, it has lots of limitations.
<p class="mrg8">
The templates may be thought as a less flexible approach rather than scripts,
but exactly this makes them easier to create using some specialized <i>visual designer tool</i>.
<p class="mrg8">
That last approach was chosen as a base for DocFlex Technology. Actually, the DocFlex templates
represent a mixture of both approaches, since small scripts called
<a href="data_processing_features.html#fq_expr"><i>FlexQuery expressions</i></a>
can be used to dynamically calculate some properties of more rigid (but visually expressible)
constructions called
<a href="templates_designer_features.html#template_components"><i>template components</i></a>.

<h2>
  <a name="templates"></a>
  2.&nbsp; What are Templates?
</h2>

The DocFlex templates are actually programs. 
The idea behind the template approach is the following.
<p class="mrg8">
If you consider how almost any Java library that generates something 
(and not only generates -- for instance, powers a GUI system) works, 
you will notice that, basically, it may be described like the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    First, we need to create a certain object representation of some controlling structure 
    (using special classes and methods of that library). 
  </li>
  <li>
    Further, we call an interpreter included in that library and pass to it that controlling structure 
    along with some data source we want to process, e.g. some data file, some interface or whatsoever. 
    (Actually, such an interpreter may be started just by calling some member method of the root object 
    representing that controlling structure. For instance, in case of a GUI system, this
    may be as simple as <code>dlg.show()</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, the interpreter processes that controlling structure and produces from 
    the data source some useful output (or shows a GUI).
  </li>
</ol>
What the actual programming is all about here, when using such a system, is the first step. 
We need to encode the creation of that controlling structure!
(And this may be a piece of work indeed...)
<p class="mrg8">
Now, let's imagine that such a controlling structure is serialized to a file
(and, therefore, can be created from it).
What is that file, then? One may call it a &ldquo;template&rdquo;!
<p class="mrg8">
But if that is a template, why not to create and edit it using some template designer GUI? 
That approach has a number of advantages:
<ul>
  <li class="mrg8">
    A designer GUI can visualize everything. 
    Now, rather than coding abstract method calls, we can visually construct the controlling structure
    using the notions of things that we expect to see in the generated output.
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    Since probably every modern document format in its core is based on the same obvious concepts 
    like flows of text with specified fonts and colors, paragraphs with specified margins, borders and 
    other properties, tables, bulleted/numbered lists, images and so on, most of such things can 
    be defined in some universal format-independent way, which can be encoded in the form of template components.
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    Such template components can be visualized in the template designer GUI. This allows easy
    manipulation with them (creating/defining, modifying, moving, coping and so on). 
    Doing the same by calling various Java methods and modifying Java code each time we need
    to change something would be a lot more cumbersome!
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    On other hand, the template interpreter will render those template components
    with the suitable features of the particular destination output format (such as HTML or RTF).
    So, we can be relieved from learning and programming lots of very complicated
    (and sometimes poorly documented) things specific to a particular format.
    Instead, we can more concentrate on our primary application task.
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    The template designer (to a large degree) ensures that the result controlling structure 
    (the template) is valid. That is, it won't hang when interpreted and will produce some output anyway.
  </li>
</ul>

DocFlex templates are exactly an implementation of that idea!
<p class="mrg8">
The following screenshot shows a template open in the 
<a href="#template_designer">Template Designer</a> (click to enlarge):

<blockquote>

<h2>
  <a name="data_sources"></a>
  <a name="dsm"></a>
  <a name="dsm_driver"></a>
  3.&nbsp; Data Sources
</h2>

DocFlex core connects to one or several data sources provided by a Java application using special 
drivers written with the <a href="#api">DocFlex API</a>.
<p class="mrg8">
Any such driver represents a particular data source in the form structurally similar to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM" target="_blank">W3C DOM</a> and understandable
for DocFlex core. Such a representation is called <b>Data Source Model</b> (or <b>DSM</b>)
and any driver supporting it -- <b>DSM Driver</b>. Such a driver provides the DSM data via special
<a name="dsm_interface"></a><b>DSM Interface</b> which it should implement.
<p class="mrg8">
<a name="dsm_element"></a>
<a name="dsm_attribute"></a>
Any DSM may be considered as a virtual XML document. It contains elements (called <b>DSM elements</b>)
and attributes (called <b>DSM attributes</b>).
However, unlike elements/attributes in XML files, DSM elements and attributes
are not real things. Actually, they are instances of specific interfaces implemented by
the DSM Driver, which makes them capable to dynamically provide a lot more information
from the underlying data source (rather than an ordinary XML document).
<p class="mrg8">
<a name="dsm_type"></a>
All possible data sources processed by the same DSM Driver are described by a certain <b>DSM Type</b>
(which may be considered as an equivalent of XML DTD).
The DSM driver should provide the data structure and type information
associated with this DSM Type via special <a name="dsm_type_interface"></a><b>DSM Type Interface</b>.
<p class="mrg8">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>
      Actually, some DSM Driver implementations may process different DSM Types. For instance,
      <a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_xml/" target="_blank">DocFlex/XML</a> includes the <i>XML Model Driver</i>,
      which works with the data from XML files. That driver can be initialized
      from different DTDs (or XML Schemas) passed as initialization parameters so as
      to represent each time a different DSM Type associated with the given DTD (or XML Schemas).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="mrg8">
In fact, all existing applications of the DocFlex Technology (such as
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_xml/" target="_blank">DocFlex/XML</a>,
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_javadoc/" target="_blank">DocFlex/Javadoc</a> and
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_together/" target="_blank">DocFlex/Together</a>)
represent little more than the DocFlex core plus one or more specific DSM drivers.

<h2>
  <a name="data_processing"></a>
  4.&nbsp; How Data Processed
</h2>

Data processing scheme implemented in DocFlex in many ways is similar to that used in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt" target="_blank">XSL Transformations</a>.
In brief, it can be described as the following.
<p class="mrg8">
DocFlex templates are built of nested components called
<a href="template_components.html#sections">sections</a>.
Most important of them are
<a href="template_components.html#element_iterator">Element Iterators</a> and
<a href="template_components.html#area_section">Area Sections</a>.
An Element Iterator performs iterations by a set of elements which it produces from the
<a href="template_components.html#context_element">context element</a>
received from the iterator's parent. The set of iterated elements is generated according to the
<a href="element_iterator_details.html#element_location_rule">Location Rules</a>,
which are settings based on a subset of <b>XPath</b> specification
(however, with some important extensions that allow traversing element references).
During the iterations, each iterated element is selected as a context element and
the iterator's content is repeated for it.
<a href="template_components.html#area_section">Area Sections</a>
do not perform iterations. Instead, they are programmed to generate some output from the context element.
The template interpretation starts from the template's root section block. The root element of the processed
XML document becomes the first context element.
<p class="mrg8">
It can be seen, that
<a href="template_components.html#element_iterator">Element Iterators</a>
produce the same effect as <code class="nowrap"><b>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</b></code> /
<code class="nowrap"><b>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</b></code>
directives and DocFlex templates themselves are analogues of XSLT-scripts.
<p class="mrg8">
However, it should be noted that DocFlex is not directly based on XSL and does not use any
XSLT processor internally. Instead, this is a completely new attempt to merge
into a single tool:

<ul>
  <li>
    The ability to work with both XML files and any data sources provided by Java applications
    in some universal way based on notions of XML and accompanying standards.
  </li>
  <li>
    The capabilities of data retrieval and processing comparable with those of XSLT (and beyond).
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to process data from multiple independent data sources (both XML files and provided by
    a Java application) and to generate by them single output.
  </li>
  <li>
    The simplicity of designing and generating the professionally formatted hypertext or plain output documents.
  </li>
</ul>

<a href="data_processing_features.html">Data Processing</a>

<p class="mrg8">
See also <a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_xml/samples/xslt_alt/" target="_blank" class="nowrap">DocFlex/XML | Samples | Alternative to XSLT</a>,
which demonstrate how DocFlex can be used as an alternative to XSL Transformations.

<h2>
  <a name="generated_output"></a>
  5.&nbsp; Generated Output
</h2>

There are two types of output that can be generated by DocFlex:
<ol>
  <li>Single file documents</li>
  <li>Framed multi-file documentation</li>
</ol>

For those output types there are two types of templates: <i>document template</i> and <i>frameset template</i>.
<p class="mrg8">
<a name="document_template"></a>
Each interpretation of a <b>document template</b> normally results in generation of a single output document.
Document templates also are the places where all the output formatting specified.
<p class="mrg8">
The DocFlex architecture was devised so that to allow designing document templates independently
on a particular destination format. The specific format is selected just at the moment of starting the generation.
All instructions and settings specified in a document templates will be rendered with appropriate features
of the selected output format. For more information about formatting techniques supported in DocFlex,
see <a href="formatting_features.html">Formatting Features</a>.
<p class="mrg8">
Each document template is associated with a particular <a href="#dsm_type">DSM Type</a>.
This DSM Type is the source of information about the data the template is intended to manipulate.
That information is used during the template design.
<p class="mrg8">
When the template is interpreted by the <a href="#generator">generator</a>,
an output document produced by it normally contains data from a single <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>
for whose type the template was designed.
<p class="mrg8">
However, DocFlex provides a way for designing document templates whose output can contain data from
several <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>s and even of different <a href="#dsm_type">DSM Types</a>.
This can be achieved by calling from the main template the subordinate ones (or <i>subtemplates</i>).
<p class="mrg8">
Each subtemplate is just yet another document template and designed the same way as the main one.
When interpreted alone it may also produce a single document. But when called from another document template
(a master) it becomes the subtemplate and can be specified to produce not a separate document but
a fragment of the main document generated by the master.
<p class="mrg8">
Since each document template can be assigned with its own <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>
the resulting document will contain data from the multiple <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>s.
Which particular <a href="#dsm">DSM</a> is passed to the subtemplate during a call
is specified when defining the subtemplate call within the master template. It is also possible
to generate hyperlinks between the document's parts produced by different <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>s.
See <a href="template_components.html#call_template">Call Template</a>
for more detail.
<p class="mrg8">
<a name="frameset_template"></a>
<b>Frameset templates</b> are entirely based on calls of subtemplates. This time, each subtemplate
call generates a separate subordinate document. A frameset template itself generates a special frameset
document which contains no actual data, but instead, specifies the frame windows where subordinate documents
are displayed.
<p class="mrg8">
A typical example of framed documentation is the output produced by
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/" target="_blank">Java 2 SDK Javadoc (Standard Doclet)</a>.
DocFlex can do just the same
(see <a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_javadoc/examples/" target="_blank">DocFlex/Javadoc | Examples</a>),
but now you can design the
<a href="data_processing_features.html#framed_doc">frameset structure</a>
by yourself and specify what exactly is loaded in the frame windows.
<p class="mrg8">
Currently, the frameset templates can generate output only in HTML format.

<h2>
  <a name="sdk"></a>
  6.&nbsp; DocFlex SDK
</h2>

DocFlex SDK (Software Development Kit) is an implementation of <a href="#top">DocFlex Technology</a>
and represents a tool for development of template-based documentation/report generators built into Java applications.
<p class="mrg8">
From the external view DocFlex SDK consists of three main components:
<ol>
  <li><a href="#api">DocFlex API</a>
  <li><a href="#template_designer">DocFlex Template Designer</a>
  <li><a href="#generator">DocFlex Generator</a>
</ol>

<h3>
  <a name="api"></a>
  DocFlex API
</h3>

Provides Java-programming interfaces for integration of the DocFlex core with
the particular Java application. These interfaces allow

<ul>
  <li class="mrg8">
     Developing the <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Drivers</a>, which represent the application's
     data in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM" target="_blank">DOM</a>-similar form
     understandable for DocFlex core.
     <p class="mrg8">
     Besides delivering the data (via <a href="#dsm_interface">DSM Interface</a>)
     and providing the data structure and type information
     (via <a href="#dsm_type_interface">DSM Type Interface</a>), a DSM Driver may also supply
     <ul>
       <li class="mrg8">
         The <b>graphic images</b>, which may represent some data elements in a specific graphical form
         (for instance, diagrams, screenshots etc.) to be inserted into the generated documentation.
         The <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Driver</a> may also provide <b>imagemaps</b>
         for such images to generate hyperlink within them.
       </li>
       <li class="mrg8">
         The <b>small</b> and <b>big icons</b> representing the data elements, which may be useful for generation
         of various summaries and references in more illustrative form.
       </li>
       <li class="mrg8">
         The additional <b>utility functions</b> which can be called within the
         <a href="data_processing_features.html#fq_expr">FlexQuery expressions</a>
         in templates to allow access to some specific data and functionality supported by the application.
       </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    Launching the <a href="#template_designer">DocFlex Template Designer</a>
    from the Java application.
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    Launch the <a href="#generator">DocFlex Generator</a> from the Java application
    with the ability to track the generation progress and show it (by the application itself in the preferred way)
    as well as to cancel the generation at any moment.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="template_designer"></a>
  DocFlex Template Designer
</h3>

Represents a high quality <i>Graphic User Interface</i> that allows creating and
designing DocFlex templates.

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex/images/designer.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/designer_s.png" title="DocFlex Template Designer" border="0"></a>
</blockquote>

This is a ready to use component.
<p class="mrg8">
The Template Designer checks all registered <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Drivers</a>
and collects the list of all available <a href="#dsm_type">DSM Types</a> supported by them.
<p class="mrg8">
Using the DSM Type information provided by a particular driver
(via <a href="#dsm_interface">DSM Interface</a>),
the Template Designer allows to design a template for a selected DSM Type.

<h3>
  <a name="generator"></a>
  DocFlex Generator
</h3>

This is another DocFlex SDK component, which represents an engine that produces the output documents.
<p class="mrg8">
Actually, the DocFlex Generator comprises a set of components because it is designed as
some abstract generator plus a number of extensions for each supported output format. Each extension,
in effect, represents a separate generator.
<p class="mrg8">
The Java application should start some of those generators and provide it with a specified template
and a <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Driver</a> initialized to supply the application's data.
The template should be designed for the <a href="#dsm_type">DSM Type</a> supported by this driver.
Then, the generator connects to the <a href="#dsm">DSM</a> provided by the driver and
by interpreting the instructions from the templates generates an output document.
<p class="mrg8">
This is a simple scheme which involves one template and one data source.
<p class="mrg8">
Actually, such a generation may be much more complicated.
The application may register multiple <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Drivers</a>
able to dynamically initialize connections to different <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>s according
to the parameters they receive from the generator.
<p class="mrg8">
Then, the generator is started as previously with a some initial template (called <i>main</i> template)
and an initial <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>. But now, the main template may call from itself
another templates (subtemplates). Those subtemplates may be designed for absolutely different
<a href="#dsm_type">DSM Types</a> (for instance, the main template may work with a specific
application's internal data source, whereas subtemplates may be designed to take their data from some
external XML files).
<p class="mrg8">
When processing such a call, the generator looks for a registered
<a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Driver</a> appropriate to the called subtemplate's DSM Type and
initializes it with the parameters specified in the call (for instance, a particular XML file name).
Then, the subtemplate is processed so it takes its data from the new <a href="#dsm">DSM</a>
initialized for it (e.g. the external XML file).
<p class="mrg8">
As the processing of the subtemplate finished, the generator returns to the main template and
continues processing it again. In the mean time, during all those changes, the generated output will
remain the same. So, the result document will contain data both as directly from the application itself
as from some external data sources (e.g. XML files).
<p class="mrg8">
Multiple <a href="#dsm_driver">DSM Drivers</a> may be used also when a Java application,
though being a single unit, may operate its data using very different interfaces (sometimes based on different
notions and directly incompatible with each other). Anyway, there may be some indirect connections between the data
provided by those interfaces and, correspondingly, a desire to generate some single documentation by those data.
<p class="mrg8">
DocFlex Technology may allow to handle such a task. For example, when developing
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_together/" target="_blank">DocFlex/Together</a>,
we have successfully integrated two absolutely different interfaces: RWI and UIBuilder (both provided
by Together OpenAPI), so to make possible generating a single documentation from the data supplied
by both of them (see
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_together/examples/index.php#ui_doc" target="_blank">DocFlex/Together | Examples | User Interface Documentation</a>).
<p class="mrg8">
The user interface for launching the generator should be implemented by the particular Java application.
Below, you can see a screenshot of the generator dialog invoked from the
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_xml/" target="_blank">DocFlex/XML</a>:

<blockquote>
  <img src="images/generator.png" title="DocFlex Generator for XML file data sources">
</blockquote>

And this is how the dialog looks, when the generator is running:

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\b\f0\fs32 Micro-Cap 9 Evaluation Version\par
\b0\fs20\par
The Evaluation Version is provided as an introduction to the Micro-Cap 9 program. It is a full working version and a highly capable product in its own right. It is provided free to schools and universities and to prospective purchasers of the Standard Version.\par
\par
\b Size Limitations:\par
\b0 Circuits are limited to 50 components and 100 equations (nodes + inductors + sources).\par
\b\par
Speed Limitations:\par
\b0 Speed is deliberately reduced. Analysis run times vary from the same for small circuits to four times longer for the largest circuits, relative to the Standard Version.\par
\par
\b Feature Limitations:\par
\b0 The use of some features such as optimization, filter design, 3D plots, PCB functions, performance plots, and multiple parameter stepping is limited. The MODEL program is not supplied with the Demo Version. Devices using the advanced models (BSIM3, BSIM4, Mextram, Modella, EKV and Philips MOSFET) are limited to a maximum of 5 in a circuit.\par
\b\par
Library Limitations:\par
\b0 A small sample model library is included instead of the extensive model libraries of the Standard Version. The Component, Shape, and Package editors have some command limitations.\par
\par
\b Help Demo:\par
\b0 The Demo option under the Help menu shows a scripted display of many features. Try it as an introduction to MC9 features and operation.\par

\b0 Cursors can now be placed on separate curves.\par
\par
\cf1\b Data Point Only waveform style\cf0\par

\cf1\b Enhanced Save Curve command\cf0\par
\b0 This command can now save in CSV format, for convenient Excel importing.\par
\par
\cf1\b Envelope command\cf0\par

\par
\cf1\b Visual probing of macros and subcircuits\cf0\par
\b0 Drill down probing lets you visually probe macro schematics or subcircuits to any level. Instead of selecting items from a list, you can probe macro objects directly. With subcircuits, you can probe directly on netlist nodes and names.\par

\par
\cf1\b .SPICE / .ENDSPICE commands\cf0\par
\b0 These new commands let you add SPICE netlist-defined circuitry to the text pages of schematics without using a subcircuit. \par
\par
\cf1\b Improved Component Find command\cf0\par
\b0 The find dialog box searches as you type.\par
\par
\cf1\b New Parameter Find command\cf0\par

\par
\cf1\b Batch file parameters\cf0\par
\b0 The Batch Script language has been enhanced so that parameters can be defined and passed from the batch file to the circuit being analyzed. Numeric output files can be named to avoid overwriting.\par

Single-Chip Machine configuration file
generated by configuration unit
<========= Users guide =========>
   There is the way to configure program modes, like
autosave, memory representation mode and so on.
Mode can be described by two lines, following
directly one after another. The first line should
contain a marker of mode, it is the mode name,
written in brackets, like [Auto save]. The second
line should necessarily be present, its containing
a kind of value which will be assigned to the
defining mode (True or +, False or -).
   Also, SCM allows to configure complex objects like diagram,
editor window etc. At this case, the marker defines as before,
value`s defenition is a bit extended. Usually, complex object
is consist of several components. Each component must be
defined as string located in a new line following directly after
previous component definition string or marker line.
The component defenition string includes:
  - name of component/parametter;
  - sign of equality;
  - value which should be assigned to the component
SCM configuration reader determines the end of complex
object at line with no values (a void line).
In conclusion, complex objects represent a multitude
of lines, where`s 1st line always consists marker, the
rest - component`s values. For example:
;[Port Bus diagram]
;Timer Interval=100
;Scale Intervals Enabled=False

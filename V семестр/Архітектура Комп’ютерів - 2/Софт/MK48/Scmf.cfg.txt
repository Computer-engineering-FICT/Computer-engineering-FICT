Single-Chip Machine configuration file
generated by configuration unit
<========= Users guide =========>
   To mount the simple object needs to have two lines,
following directly one after another.
The first line should contain the marker of object,
it`s an object`s name, written in brackets, like [Desktop].
The second line should necessarily be present and to contain
a kind of value which will be assigned to the
object (True or +, False or -).
   Also, SCM allows to mount complex objects like diagram,
editor etc. At this case, the marker defines as before, but
value`s defenition is a bit expanded. Mostly, complex object
needs to define several its components. Thus, each component
value sets at the new line following directly after previous
component value or marker line. The line with
value includes:
  - name of component (parameter);
  - sign of equality;
  - value which should be assigned to the component
SCM configuration reader determines the end of complex
object at line with no values (a void line).
In conclusion, complex objects are represented by multitude
of lines, where`s 1st line always consists marker, the
rest - component`s values. For example:
;[Port Bus diagram]
;Timer Interval=100
;Scale Intervals Enabled=False

N.C. = No Connect. This pin has no internal connection to the device.
VCCINT = Dedicated power pin, which MUST be connected to VCC (2.5 volts).

VCCIO2 = Dedicated power pin, which MUST be connected to VCC (3.3 volts).
GND = Dedicated ground pin or unused dedicated input, which MUST be connected to GND.
GND* = These I/O pins can either be left unconnected or connected to GND. Connecting these pins to GND will improve the device's immunity to noise.

PDn = Power Down pin. 
@ = Special-purpose pin. 
# = JTAG Boundary-Scan Testing/In-System Programming or Configuration Pin. The JTAG inputs TMS and TDI should be tied to VCC and TCK should be tied to GND when not in use.
& = JTAG pin used for I/O. When used as user I/O, JTAG pins must be kept stable before and during configuration.  JTAG pin stability prevents accidental loading of JTAG instructions.

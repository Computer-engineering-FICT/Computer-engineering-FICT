        Floating-Point Library for Integer Processors (FLIP)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The FLIP  library is a  C library for  the software support  of single
precision  floating-point  (FP) arithmetic  on  processors without  FP
hardware  units such  as  VLIW  or DSP  processor  cores for  embedded
applications.  FLIP  provides  the  basic five  operations:  addition,
subtraction,   multiplication,   division   and  square-root   for   a
quasi-fully compliant  single-precision (SP)  IEEE 754 FP  format (the
flags are not supported).  But this library also provides some running
modes with relaxed characteristics:  no denormal numbers or restricted
rounding modes for instance.

The current version of the FLIP library is targeted to VLIW (very long
instruction   word)  processor   cores  of   the  ST200   family  from
STMicroelectronics.

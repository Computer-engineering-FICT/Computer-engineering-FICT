    SWI-Prolog License Conditions 
    <HR>
    </H1></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Preamble</H2>
<P>SWI-Prolog licensing aims at a large audience, combining ideas from the <A 
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</A> and the less principal 
<A href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</A>. The license 
aims at: 
<UL>
  <LI>Make SWI-Prolog itself and its libraries are `As free as possible'. 
  <LI>Allow for easy integration of <A 
  href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/license.html#contrib">contributions</A>. 
  <LI>Free software can build on SWI-Prolog without limitations. 
  <LI>Non-free (open or proprietary) software can be produced using SWI-Prolog, 
  although contributed pure <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A> components cannot be used. 
  </LI></UL>
<P>To achieve this, different parts of the system have different licenses. 
SWI-Prolog programs consists of a mixture of `native' code (source compiled to 
machine instructions) and `virtual machine' code (Prolog source compiled to 
SWI-Prolog virtual machine instructions, covering both compiled SWI-Prolog 
libraries and your compiled application). 
<H2>The SWI-Prolog kernel and foreign libraries</H2>
<P>The SWI-Prolog kernel and our foreign libraries are distributed under the <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Lesser GNU Public License</A>, 
also called the <B>LGPL</B>. A Prolog executable consists of the combination of 
these `native' code components and Prolog virtual machine code. The SWI-Prolog 
<B>plrc</B> utility allows for disassembling and re-assembling these parts, a 
process satisfying article <B>6b</B> of the LGPL. 
<P>Under the LGPL SWI-Prolog can be linked to code distributed under arbitrary 
licenses, provided a number of requirements are fullfilled. The most important 
requirement is that, if an application relies on a <EM>modified</EM> version of 
SWI-Prolog, the modified sources must be made available. 
<H3>Contributed foreign libraries</H3>
<P>Foreign libraries <EM>contributed</EM> to the SWI-Prolog project must have 
license conditions that are compatible to the <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</A> or the <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A>. Applications using 
SWI-Prolog must satisfy the license restrictions of all modules. 
<H2>The SWI-Prolog Prolog libraries</H2>
<P>Lacking a satisfactory technical solution to handle article <B>6</B> of the 
LGPL, this license cannot be used for the Prolog source code that is part of the 
SWI-Prolog system (both libraries and kernel code). This situation is comparable 
to <CODE>libgcc</CODE>, the runtime library used with the GNU C-compiler. 
Therefore, we use the same proven license terms as this library. The libgcc 
license is the <A href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A>, 
accompanied with a special exception. Below we rephrased this exception adjusted 
to our needs: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>As a special exception, if you link this library with other 
  files, compiled with a Free Software compiler, to produce an executable, this 
  library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the 
  GNU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any 
  other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General 
  Public License. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Keeping it free, open and practical</H2>
<P>The above sounds a bit complicated. To facilitate this heterogeneous license 
system</B> we have added some machinery to SWI-Prolog: 
<DL>
  <DT><B>:- license(License)</B>
  <DD>This directive can be used in any SWI-Prolog source file. 
  <VAR>License</VAR> denotes one of the established free software licenses or 
  <CODE>swipl</CODE>, referring to the GPL plus the SWI-Prolog Prolog code 
  exception. 
  <P>Please check the SWI-Prolog manual for details on accepted license 
  identifiers. </P>
  <DT><B>PL_license(const char *module-id, enum PL_license_t license)</B>
  <DD>Allows for registering license information from foreign code through the 
  foreign-language interface. For example, the GNU readline library is linked to 
  the system using

  <DD>This toplevel predicate summarises the license requirements of all loaded 
  modules. </DD></DL>
<H2><A name=contrib>Contributing to the SWI-Prolog project</A></H2>
<P>To achieve maximal coherence using SWI-Prolog for Free and Non-Free software 
we advice the use of the LGPL for contributed foreign code and the use of the 
GPL with SWI-Prolog exception for Prolog code for contributed modules. 
<P>As a rule of thumb it is advised to use the above licenses whenever possible 
and only use a strict GPL compliant license only if the module contains other 
code under strict GPL compliant licenses.

<H2><A NAME="sec:8.7"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.7</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Multi-threaded 
mixed C and Prolog applications</SPAN></A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:foreignthread"></A>

<P>All foreign-code linked to the multi-threading version of SWI-Prolog 
should be thread-safe (<EM>reentrant</EM>) or guarded in Prolog using
<A NAME="idx:withmutex2:1346"></A><A class="pred" href="threadsync.html#with_mutex/2">with_mutex/2</A> 
from simultaneous access from multiple Prolog threads. If you want to 
write mixed multi-threaded C and Prolog application you should first 
familiarise yourself with writing multi-threaded applications in C 
(C++).

<P>If you are using SWI-Prolog as an embedded engine in a multi-threaded 
application you can access the Prolog engine from multiple threads by 
creating an <EM>engine</EM> in each thread from which you call Prolog. 
Without creating an engine, a thread can only use functions that do
<EM>not</EM> use the <CODE>term_t</CODE> type (for example 
PL_new_atom()).

<P>The system supports two models. <A class="sec" href="foreignthread.html">Section 
8.7.1</A> describes the original one-to-one mapping. In this schema a 
native thread attaches a Prolog thread if it needs to call Prolog and 
detaches is when finished, as opposed to the model from <A class="sec" href="foreignthread.html">section 
8.7.2</A> where threads temporary use a Prolog engine.

<H3><A NAME="sec:8.7.1"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.7.1</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">A 
Prolog thread for each native thread (one-to-one)</SPAN></A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:threadoneone"></A>

<P>In the one-to-one model, the thread that called PL_initialise() has a 
Prolog engine attached. If another C-thread in the system wishes to call 
Prolog it must first attach an engine using PL_thread_attach_engine() 
and call PL_thread_destroy_engine() after all Prolog work is finished. 
This model is especially suitable with long running threads that need to 
do Prolog work regularly. See <A class="sec" href="foreignthread.html">section 
8.7.2</A> for the alternative many-to-many model.

<DL>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="PL_thread_self()"><VAR>int</VAR> <STRONG>PL_thread_self</STRONG>(<VAR></VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Returns the integer Prolog identifier of the engine or -1 if the calling 
thread has no Prolog engine. This function is also provided in the 
single-threaded version of SWI-Prolog, where it returns -2.</DD>

<DD class="defbody">

<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="PL_thread_attach_engine()"><VAR>int</VAR> <STRONG>PL_thread_attach_engine</STRONG>(<VAR>const 
PL_thread_attr_t *attr</VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Creates a new Prolog engine in the calling thread. If the calling thread 
already has an engine the reference count of the engine is incremented. 
The <VAR>attr</VAR> argument can be <CODE>NULL</CODE> to create a thread 
with default attributes. Otherwise it is a pointer to a structure with 
the definition below. For any field with value `0', the default is used. 
The <CODE>cancel</CODE> field may be filled with a pointer to a function 
that is called when PL_cleanup() terminates the running Prolog engines. 
If this function is not present or returns <CODE>FALSE</CODE> 
pthread_cancel() is used.

<PRE class="code">
typedef struct
{ unsigned long     local_size;    /* Stack sizes (K-bytes) */

  int              (*cancel)(int thread);
} PL_thread_attr_t;
</PRE>

<P>The structure may be destroyed after PL_thread_attach_engine() has 
returned. On success it returns the Prolog identifier for the thread (as 
returned by PL_thread_self()). If an error occurs, -1 is returned. If 
this Prolog is not compiled for multi-threading, -2 is returned.</DD>

success and <CODE>FALSE</CODE> if the calling thread has no engine or 
this Prolog does not support threads.

<P>Please note that construction and destruction of engines are 
relatively expensive operations. Only destroy an engine if performance 
is not critical and memory is a critical resource.</DD>

<H3><A NAME="sec:8.7.2"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.7.2</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Pooling 
Prolog engines (many-to-many)</SPAN></A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:threadmanymany"></A>

<P>In this model Prolog engines live as entities that are independent 
from threads. If a thread needs to call Prolog it takes one of the 
engines from the pool and returns the engine when done. This model is 
suitable in the following identified cases:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Compatibility with the single-threaded version</I><BR>
In the single-threaded version, foreign threads must serialise access 
the one and only thread engine. Functions from this section allow 
sharing one engine among multiple threads.

<P>
<LI><I>Many native threads with infrequent Prolog work</I><BR>
Prolog threads are expensive in terms of memory and time to create and 
destroy them. Systems that use a large number of threads that only 
infrequently need to call Prolog are better take an engine from a pool 
and return it there.

<P>
<LI><I>Prolog status must be handed to another thread</I><BR>
This situation has been identified by Uwe Lesta when creating a .NET 
interface for SWI-Prolog. .NET distributes work for active internet 
connection over a pool of threads. If a Prolog engine contains state for 
a connection, it must be possible to detach the engine from a thread and 
re-attach it to another thread handling the same connection.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="PL_create_engine()"><VAR>PL_engine_t</VAR> <STRONG>PL_create_engine</STRONG>(<VAR>PL_thread_attr_t 
*attributes</VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Create a new Prolog engine. <VAR>attributes</VAR> is described with 
PL_thread_attach_engine(). Any thread can make this call after 
PL_initialise() returned success. The returned engine is not attached to 
any thread and lives until PL_destroy_engine() is used on the returned 
handle.

<P>In the single-threaded version this call always returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>, 
indicating failure.</DD>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="PL_destroy_engine()"><VAR>int</VAR> <STRONG>PL_destroy_engine</STRONG>(<VAR>PL_engine_t 
e</VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Destroy the given engine. Destroying an engine is only allowed if the 
engine is not attached to any thread or attached to the calling thread. 
On success this function returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE>, on failure the 
return value is <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.</DD>
<DT class="pubdef"><A NAME="PL_set_engine()"><VAR>int</VAR> <STRONG>PL_set_engine</STRONG>(<VAR>PL_engine_t 
engine, PL_engine_t *old</VAR>)</A></DT>
<DD class="defbody">
Make the calling thread ready to use <VAR>engine</VAR>. If <VAR>old</VAR> 
is non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> the current engine associated with the calling 
thread is stored at the given location. If <VAR>engine</VAR> equals
<CODE>PL_ENGINE_MAIN</CODE> the initial engine is attached to the 
calling thread. If <VAR>engine</VAR> is <CODE>PL_ENGINE_CURRENT</CODE> 
the engine is not changed. This can be used to query the current engine. 
This call returns
<CODE>PL_ENGINE_SET</CODE> if the engine was switched successfully,
<CODE>PL_ENGINE_INVAL</CODE> if <VAR>engine</VAR> is not a valid engine 
handle and
<CODE>PL_ENGINE_INUSE</CODE> if the engine is currently in use by 
another thread.

<P>Engines can be changed at any time. For example, it is allowed to 
select an engine to initiate a Prolog goal, detach it and at a later 
moment execute the goal from another thread. Note however that the
<CODE>term_t</CODE>, <CODE>qid_t</CODE> and <CODE>fid_t</CODE> types are 
interpreted relative to the engine for which they are created. Behaviour 
when passing one of these types from one engine to another is undefined.

<P>In the single-threaded version this call only succeeds if <VAR>engine</VAR> 
refers to the main engine.

<H4><A NAME="sec:8.7.2.1"><SPAN class="sec-nr">8.7.2.1</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Engines 
in single-threaded SWI-Prolog</SPAN></A></H4>

<P>In theory it is possible to port the API of <A class="sec" href="foreignthread.html">section 
8.7.2</A> to the single-threaded version of SWI-Prolog. This allows 
C-programs to control multiple Prolog engines concurrently. This has not 
yet been realised.
